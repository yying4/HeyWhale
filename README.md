This Repository will contain three tasks which are about Perceptron, Neural Network and Semantic Segmentation respectively. All these tasks will be implemented by Python. This is a process of learning by doing.

The first task is to achive a training process using Perceptron. In the file 'Perceptron.py', numpy was used to predict and update weight iteratively. The purpose of this task is to learn how the Perceptron works and understand each step in the algorithm.

The second task is to achieve a Backpropagation using tensorflow to calssify pictures of written numbers in MNIST as 0-9. Backpropagation (calculate loss from output to each layer backwards) was used to update the weights and biases in the nerual network to improve accuracy.The first file is to do backpropagation without using keras - "Backpropagation.py". The next backpropagation is to by using keras - "Keras_Back".
