This Repository will contain three tasks which are about Perceptron, Neural Network and Semantic Segmentation respectively. All these tasks will be implemented by Python. This is a process of learning by doing.

The first task is to achive a training process using Perceptron. In the file 'Perceptron.py', numpy was used to predict and update weight iteratively. The purpose of this task is to learn how the Perceptron works and understand each step in the algorithm.
